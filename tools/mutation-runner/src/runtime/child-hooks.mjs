/**
 * Installs the runtime for one test file process and its test hooks. The
 * process loads one test file, so each module-scope hit belongs to this
 * file. The active mutant is set before the test file imports a source file.
 *
 * `report(row, context)` gets `{ hits, static_hits, overlap }` for each
 * finished test, with the argument of the `afterEach` hook. `overlap` is true
 * when tests ran at the same time (for example concurrent tests). The hits
 * then cannot name their test, so the adapter gives each test of the file
 * the hits of the file.
 *
 * `children` is the optional child coverage of the Node processes that a
 * test starts: `startTest()` runs before each test, and the hits that
 * `finishTest()` gives join the hits of the test.
